      <description>Click on your ward on the map below to get a ready-made e-mail that you can send to your local councillor to show support for 20mph across West Bridgford.
When you click on the map, your e-mail programme should pop up with some pre-prepared text and the correct e-mail addresses for the councillors in your ward. (Any problems, please let me know).
If you prefer to copy and paste bits and pieces of the template or to write your own text, scroll down for where to find details about your ward, councillors and more.</description>

      <description>To raise awareness about the actual number of traffic accidents in our neighbourhood I have decided to do some number crunching and plotting (since this is what I do a lot of in my day job as a scientist).
I will try to bring out the numbers as clearly as I can (and I will let them speak for themselves). There is no claim for completeness, but if you want to inspect how I went about it the code (in R) is published on my github page: https://github.</description>

      <description>On the morning of 11 October I decided to write a public facebook post about making West Bridgford a 20mph zone. The aim would be to lower the speed limit on residential roads from 30mph to 20mph.
The arguments in favour are simple:
  safety there are many, many children on the road (pedestrians and cyclists) at all times of day and 20mph is much safer
  environment, both in terms of emissions and how people not in cars can make use of the roads</description>
