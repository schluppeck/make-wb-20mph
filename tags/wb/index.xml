      <description>In amazing effort, the students at the West Bridgford Junior School have put their creativity into designing posters to make people think about slowing down!
Mrs Arnold and the Community Hub Team at the school organised an art competition and got an amazing response across all year groups.
You can see all the art work at https://wbjs-art.netlify.app/
The four winning entries (after intense voting) were:
Look out for giant versions of them around the school!</description>

      <title>Results of informal survey</title>

      <description>Together with my original facebook post, I put together a very short survey and asked the following questions:
“What do you think about making the speed limit on all residential roads in WB 20mph?”
 “Any other ideas / comments / questions?”
 “Your e-mail address (optional)” - for letting people know what I found out.
  An important caveat here is that this is not a scientific poll and just because there are lots of positive views expressed here doesn’t necessarily mean that the same proportion of people in all of WB feel this way.</description>

      <description>On the morning of 11 October I decided to write a public facebook post about making West Bridgford a 20mph zone. The aim would be to lower the speed limit on residential roads from 30mph to 20mph.
The arguments in favour are simple:
  safety there are many, many children on the road (pedestrians and cyclists) at all times of day and 20mph is much safer
  environment, both in terms of emissions and how people not in cars can make use of the roads</description>
