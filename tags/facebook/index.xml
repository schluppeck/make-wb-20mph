      <description>More than 70% of people in Britain support 20mph speed limits.1 There are many benefits, but three big ones are that it is
 healthier&amp;hellip; by encouraging people to hop on the bike or walk on more friendly roads safer&amp;hellip; larger speeds = more accidents and more serious injury cleaner&amp;hellip; there is much less pollution at slower speeds, particularly for stop-and-go accelerating as is common in residential area  People in NG support it There are plenty of places across the UK that are campaigning for 20mph and many, like Nottingham City2, have decided to go for it.</description>

      <description>On the morning of 11 October I decided to write a public facebook post about making West Bridgford a 20mph zone. The aim would be to lower the speed limit on residential roads from 30mph to 20mph.
The arguments in favour are simple:
  safety there are many, many children on the road (pedestrians and cyclists) at all times of day and 20mph is much safer
  environment, both in terms of emissions and how people not in cars can make use of the roads</description>
