      <p>Great news about efforts to make the roads in our neighbourhoods safer and more attractive for walking, running, cycling, and generally being active.</p>
<p>Nottinghamshire county council has voted unanimously in support of a motion to explore 20mph in residential areas across Nottinghamshire (see also <a href="https://westbridgfordwire.com/council-to-explore-the-introduction-of-more-20mph-speed-limits-in-nottinghamshire/">coverage on the local news</a>). While &ldquo;exploring 20mph&rdquo; may sound like hedging, I personally think that the buy-in and support on show from all sides (across party affiliations) is an important step in the right direction.</p>
<p>But the statement from the Transport and Environment Committee chairman sounds like this won&rsquo;t be a slam dunk&hellip; so it&rsquo;s important to keep making the case that <strong>20&rsquo;s plenty</strong> for us here.</p>
<h2 id="students-teachers-and-parents-are-also-getting-involved">Students, teachers and parents are also getting involved</h2>
<p>Students and teachers at West Bridgford Junior School picked up on the idea of road safety as part of a <strong>Community Ambassador</strong> scheme. This scheme has been set up by Mrs Arnold, one of the year 6 teachers. The aim is to encourage students at the school to engage with the local community. She told the local <em>West Bridgford Wire</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;â€œItâ€™s really important to us as a school to get more involved in the community locally, and this year weâ€™re getting started with our â€˜Community hubâ€™ which will see a series of exciting events out and about in West Bridgford.</p>
<p>â€œ&hellip; we felt it was vital to talk about road safety and awareness with our children, as many already walk to school over some pretty busy roads.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the activities on their <em>road safety day</em> was to design a poster to raise awareness about speeding and the benefits of slowing things down to 20mph. <strong>Watch this space!</strong> - ðŸŽ¨ðŸ˜€</p>
