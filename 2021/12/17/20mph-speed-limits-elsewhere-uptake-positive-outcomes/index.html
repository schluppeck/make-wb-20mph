      <p>To see the old year out and a hopefully much better 2022 in, a quick reminder on two points:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>a recent decision in the <em>Scottish Borders Council</em> shows that 20mph can work and is popular!<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to let your councillors know what you think (hopes as well as concerns&hellip;)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-about-the-scottish-borders">What about the Scottish Borders?</h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Scottish Borders Council agree by 26-5 to keep the 20mph limits set throughout communities after very positive speed reduction outcomes. <a href="https://t.co/i4VZorNDDO">pic.twitter.com/i4VZorNDDO</a></p>&mdash; Rod King MBE 30kmh/20mph limit champion (@20splentyforus) <a href="https://twitter.com/20splentyforus/status/1471473309967659008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<h2 id="how-to-write-to-the-council">How to write to the council</h2>
<p>There is a <a href="https://www.nottinghamshire.gov.uk/dms/Committees/tabid/62/ctl/ViewCMIS_CommitteeDetails/mid/381/id/536/Default.aspx">Transport &amp; Environment committee</a> meeting coming up in the new year (5 January).</p>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://schluppeck.github.io/make-wb-20mph/2021/11/26/letter-to-transport-and-environment-committee/">a post on how you can get in touch with them</a>. Back in October I wrote to Neil Clarke, MBE, and received a very detailed and thoughtful reply!</p>
<p>Clearly, that committee has a lot of difficult decisions to make and it was interesting to hear some perspectives from someone who represents a more rural area.</p>
<h2 id="and-finally">and finally&hellip;</h2>
<p>Merry christmas and have a good start into the new year!</p>

<p>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Borders">Scottish Borders</a> is obviously not Nottingham, if that comparison worries you, but it contains Edinburgh (a city) and is comparable in population to Rushcliffe, but quite a bit larger in area. The interesting thing is that there was large support for 20mph in population and that the decision was also supported by a large majority in the council.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
