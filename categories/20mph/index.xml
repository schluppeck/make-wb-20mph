      <description>Great news about efforts to make the roads in our neighbourhoods safer and more attractive for walking, running, cycling, and generally being active.
Nottinghamshire county council has voted unanimously in support of a motion to explore 20mph in residential areas across Nottinghamshire (see also coverage on the local news). While &amp;ldquo;exploring 20mph&amp;rdquo; may sound like hedging, I personally think that the buy-in and support on show from all sides (across party affiliations) is an important step in the right direction.</description>

      <description>Happy new year, with the hope that 2022 may be less messed up than the previous 2 years. First and foremost with less COVID-19 and more good health for everyone.
  Interesting times ahead, as a motion on 20mph in residential areas is on the agenda at the full county council meeting on Thursday 20 Jan 2022.
At this stage, the discussion is not quite about adopting the 20mph limit wholesale, but whether to task the Transport &amp;amp; Environment Committee &amp;ldquo;with exploring the feasibility of implementing a 20MPH speed limit on residential roads&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>To see the old year out and a hopefully much better 2022 in, a quick reminder on two points:
  a recent decision in the Scottish Borders Council shows that 20mph can work and is popular!1
  to let your councillors know what you think (hopes as well as concerns&amp;hellip;)
  What about the Scottish Borders? Scottish Borders Council agree by 26-5 to keep the 20mph limits set throughout communities after very positive speed reduction outcomes.</description>

      <description>Two quick questions to make you think about your driving habits. It&amp;rsquo;s been many years for most of us since we had to answer them for a driving test&amp;hellip;
Stopping distances...  What&#39;s the typical stopping distance for a car travelling at 30mph? 6 car lengths, about 23m. Before most people can react and start hitting the breaks, the car has travelled about 10m
A car hitting a pedestrian at 27mph is equivalent to falling out out a 3rd story window.</description>

      <description>many items on Notts CC agenda &amp;hellip; which means that the petition (and motion) to consider 20mph default speed limit couldn&amp;rsquo;t be discussed. Tweet from Cllr Penny Gowland:
Still didn&amp;#39;t get to discuss 20s plenty @schluppeck .. 4th time lucky
&amp;mdash; Penny Gowland (@Penny_Gowland) November 25, 2021  But things don&amp;rsquo;t happen instantly - and so I have decided to be constructive with the extra time and to write to the Transport &amp;amp; Environment Committee of the Nottinghamshire CC in the meantime.</description>
