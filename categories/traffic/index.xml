      <description>The Nottinghamshire county council webpage has a lot of detail about what it does and what people&amp;rsquo;s roles are. However, I found getting hold of e-mail addresses (if you want more than 1 at a time) a bit hard.
  So I used a bit of code/magic to extract the emails for the 2021-2025 Nottingham county councillors:
  The list of email addresses in text / CSV format is easier to handle.</description>

      <description>many items on Notts CC agenda &amp;hellip; which means that the petition (and motion) to consider 20mph default speed limit couldn&amp;rsquo;t be discussed.
Still didn&amp;#39;t get to discuss 20s plenty @schluppeck .. 4th time lucky
&amp;mdash; Penny Gowland (@Penny_Gowland) November 25, 2021  Things take time - and so I have decided to write to the Transport &amp;amp; Environment Committee of the Nottinghamshire CC in the meantime. Their next meeting is early in 2022 (5 Jan) and I thought it would be great to find out their views&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>20mph has wide support across the UK, not just WB</title>

      <description>More than 70% of people in Britain support 20mph speed limits.1 There are many benefits, but three big ones are that it is
 healthier&amp;hellip; by encouraging people to hop on the bike or walk on more friendly roads safer&amp;hellip; larger speeds = more accidents and more serious injury cleaner&amp;hellip; there is much less pollution at slower speeds, particularly for stop-and-go accelerating as is common in residential areas  People in NG support it There are plenty of places across the UK that are campaigning for 20mph and many, like Nottingham City2, have decided to go for it.</description>

      <description>Since I first put up a map of traffic accidents / casualties at the start of October ’21, the Department for Transport has updated its openly accessible data. This means that now data for the years between 2016 and 2020 is easily accessible.
I think knowing when accidents are most common is as important as known where they occur across our county.</description>

      <title>Results of informal survey</title>
      <link>https://schluppeck.github.io/make-wb-20mph/2021/10/15/results-of-informal-survey/</link>

      <description>Together with my original facebook post, I put together a very short survey and asked the following questions:
“What do you think about making the speed limit on all residential roads in WB 20mph?”
 “Any other ideas / comments / questions?”
 “Your e-mail address (optional)” - for letting people know what I found out.
  An important caveat here is that this is not a scientific poll and just because there are lots of positive views expressed here doesn’t necessarily mean that the same proportion of people in all of WB feel this way.</description>

      <description>To raise awareness about the actual number of traffic accidents in our neighbourhood I have decided to do some number crunching and plotting (since this is what I do a lot of in my day job as a scientist).
I will try to bring out the numbers as clearly as I can (and I will let them speak for themselves). There is no claim for completeness, but if you want to inspect how I went about it the code (in R) is published on my github page: https://github.</description>
